    FILIPINO esports team Bren Esports made history at the weekend, becoming the first Philippine squad to win the Mobile Legends: Bang Bang M2 World Championship title.
 </p>

 <p style="margin-left: 436px; margin-right: 650px;font-family: Arial;">
    Bren defeated Burmese Ghouls, 4-3, in their best-of-seven finals held in Singapore on Sunday.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 436px; margin-right: 650px;font-family: Arial;">   
    The team achieved the amazing feat despite being relegated to the lower bracket early on in the tournament.
   </p> 
 <br>
<p style="margin-left: 436px; margin-right: 650px;font-family: Arial;">   
    The Bren crew of CJ Ribo (“Ribo”), Karl Gabriel Nepomuceno (“KarlTzy”), Allan Castamayor (“Lusty”), David
    <br>Charles Canon (“FlapTzy”), team captain Angelo Kyle Arcangel (“Pheww”), Mico Sampang (“Coco”), and
    <br>Efphraim Sambrano (“Ejhay”) showed tremendous drive, racking up key victories after dropping its opening game to barge into the finals.
</p>
<br>
<p style="margin-left: 436px; margin-right: 650px;font-family: Arial;">   
    Bren took an early lead in the finals over the Ghouls, going up, 2-0, led by KarlTzy.
 </p>   
 <br>
 <p style="margin-left: 436px; margin-right: 650px;font-family: Arial;"> 
    But the Ghouls would recover after, taking the next three matches to overtake Bren, 3-2.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p style="margin-left: 436px; margin-right: 650px;font-family: Arial;">   
        The team from the Philippines then regained its footing, making the needed adjustments to better compete with the Ghouls; a move that paid huge dividends as it took the next two games to bag the hard-earned victory.
        </p>
        <br>
     <p style="margin-left: 436px; margin-right: 650px;font-family: Arial;">  
        For its victory, Bren took the large chunk of the $300,000 pool prize, while KarlTzy was named Finals MVP and was awarded $3,000.
        </p>
        <br>
    <p style="margin-left: 436px; margin-right: 650px;font-family: Arial;">    
        Following the landmark conquest, Bren officials praised the players for their efforts while also underscoring as key their decision to take the necessary path in trying to go world-class and elevate the sport.
        </p>
        <br>
    <p style="margin-left: 436px; margin-right: 650px;font-family: Arial;">   
        “We started by believing that we had a good idea of how we can create world-class professional Esports Athletes,
        ” said Bren Esports COO Jab Escutin in a Facebook post following their win. “And now, here we have shown what 
        happens when we treat our Esports athletes as professionals in their own right, by giving them an environment
         where they can be adults and be treated with respect for their craft and the hard work it requires to be able 
         to perform consistently at the highest levels. To understand that your peers are not only playing games all day, 
         but instead appreciate that they are working hard to be the very best,” he added.
        </p>
        <br>
     <p style="margin-left: 436px; margin-right: 650px;font-family: Arial;">  
        Mr. Escutin went on to thank all their supporters and those who believe in their push to elevate esports in the country.
